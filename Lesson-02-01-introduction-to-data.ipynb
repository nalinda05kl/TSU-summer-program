    "People turn to data because they have a story to tell or a problem to solve. Most people start with a question, then look to data for answers. In a service setting, questions might include, “who is receiving services?” and “who does best in treatment?”\n",
    "What if you do not have a question to begin with? Exploring data without a defined question, sometimes referred to as “data mining”, can sometimes reveal interesting patterns in the data that are worth exploring. Regardless of what leads you to look at data, thinking about your audience (your staff, supervisor, Board members, etc.) is helpful to shape the story and guide your thinking about the data.\n",
    "Whenever you look at data, it is important to be open to unexpected patterns, explanations, and unusual results. Sometimes the most interesting stories to be told with data are not the ones you set out to tell."
